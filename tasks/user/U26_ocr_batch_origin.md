Recovering OCR Batch Origin from Character Noise
 Given a bag of unlabeled text snippets, group them by shared origin — the same family of problems as document clustering or authorship clustering, applied here to OCR provenance instead of authorship. There is no single-item anomaly score and nothing is flagged as outlying; every snippet in a bag belongs to some group, and the task is to recover the grouping.

Real historical newspapers were digitized in batches by a national, multi-decade newspaper-digitization program. Different batches were processed by different digitization pipelines — different OCR engines, engine versions, vendor settings, and scanning eras — over many years. Your task is to recover which digitization batch produced each piece of OCR'd text — using only the systematic character-error fingerprint that batch's pipeline left behind, never the actual words.

How this differs from adjacent tasks
Not OCR accuracy / quality scoring — nothing here is graded against a corrected transcript; the OCR is never cleaned or corrected, and its errors are the signal, not the thing being measured.
Not authorship or stylometry clustering — the grouping variable is a processing pipeline, not a writer, and the design deliberately blocks the authorship shortcut: every snippet in a bag is drawn from a different article, so topic and voice carry no grouping signal.
Not closed-set classification — the 16 test batches never appear in training; there is no fixed label set to predict into, only an unseen grouping to recover.
Not a fixed-k clustering benchmark — the true number of groups is never given and varies bag to bag (2 to 4 here), so a solution can't assume or be handed the cluster count.
Task
You are given bags of text snippets. Every snippet in a bag is drawn from a DIFFERENT real newspaper article, so the article's subject matter tells you nothing about which snippets belong together — only the OCR noise pattern does. Some unknown number of snippets in a bag came from each of several real digitization batches, and your job is to recover that grouping.

You do not need to name which real batch a group came from — only which snippets travelled together.
The number of true groups in a bag is not given and varies bag to bag.
Each snippet's text is genuinely noisy, uncorrected OCR output: character substitutions, junk characters, and broken word boundaries are real artifacts of period OCR engines running on period newspaper print.
Why this is not a text-generation or classification task
This is a program-writing and modeling task, not a text-generation task. You are not asked to clean the text, name a batch, or classify a snippet into a known category — every test batch is entirely unseen in training. You are asked to recover a partition: which items share a hidden real-world grouping variable. Write a fallback submission.csv (every snippet in its own group is a safe, valid, scoreable starting point) before you start building your real approach.

Dataset
Discover the data directory rather than assuming a fixed path — it may be mounted differently across environments:

from pathlib import Path

DATA = next(
    p for p in (Path("/data"), Path("dataset/public"),
                Path("/kaggle/input/pipeline-attribution-dataset/public"))
    if (p / "test.csv").exists()
)

Files in the data directory:

train.csv — columns row_id, text, batch_id. Every row is labeled with the digitization batch it came from. batch_id is an opaque label (batch_00, batch_07, …) that is consistent per real batch but is not the archive's own batch name — the label's value carries no information, only its grouping does. row_id is likewise an opaque per-row index (e.g. train_00000); it exists only so every file shares the same identifier-first schema. Use text/batch_id however you like: train a classifier, an embedding model, or hand-engineer features — the point is to learn what makes one pipeline's OCR noise look different from another's, in a way that generalizes to pipelines you have never seen labeled examples from.
test.csv — columns row_id, text. No labels. row_id is formatted {bag_id}::{opaque sequence number} — split it on :: to recover the bag a row belongs to; the part after :: is the snippet's position within its bag (0, 1, 2, …) — it identifies nothing about the snippet's origin, and it is the order in which your submission lists that bag's labels. bag_id is deliberately the only thing row_id reveals: keeping every file's column set minimal (row_id + one payload column) means test.csv and answers.csv share only the join key, never a duplicated identifier or a disguised label. The withheld target is the batch of each row — present only in private/answers.csv (one row per bag: bag_id, batch_id), never in test.csv. Rows whose row_id shares a bag_id prefix are the snippets you must partition together. A bag's rows are listed in shuffled order — position carries no information.
sample_submission.csv — columns bag_id, batch_id, one row per bag. A valid, minimum-viable submission (every snippet placed in its own group: batch_id = "0 1 2 … n-1"). It scores 0.000, not an error.
dataset_stats.json — counts and split statistics for the shipped data. Counts only: no batch identity, train or test, is published anywhere in the data directory.
Every test row is a distinct source snippet — no snippet appears twice in test.csv — so each row contributes to exactly one bag's score. Shipped text is a contiguous window of the source OCR region (most of it, drawn from a private seed), not the region verbatim; the OCR noise the task is about is a property of the character stream and is unaffected.

Rules
Use only the data directory. The text is real, uncorrected OCR from a public archive, and searchable there. Recovering the grouping by matching test rows back to that archive, or to any external copy or derivative of it, is not solving the task — a submission built that way is invalid regardless of its score, and so is any submission that depends on data not shipped in the data directory. The solver environment is expected to have no network access; your solution must run to completion from the data directory alone.

Partition each bag on its own. Only 16 batches underlie the 110 test bags, so pooling every test row, clustering the whole test set globally, and cutting the result back into bags is a transductive shortcut — it recovers corpus structure, not a generalisable notion of pipeline similarity. It is prohibited: when you partition a bag, the only test rows you may use are that bag's own. Using train.csv however you like (classifier, metric learning, embedding) is the intended path; using other test bags' rows is not. This shortcut was measured during construction at 0.094 ARI (below the 0.342 reference) and is banned as a matter of rule, not because it is strong.

Evaluation
Submissions are scored using mean per-bag Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), clipped to [0, 1] and averaged across all test bags.

from sklearn.metrics import adjusted_rand_score

def score_bag(true_batch_ids: list, submitted_groups: list) -> float:
    return max(0.0, adjusted_rand_score(true_batch_ids, submitted_groups))

Why ARI, and why chance-correction matters here. The task is partition recovery, not classification against fixed class names — a bag's true group count and identities are unknown to the solver, so any metric has to compare two groupings of the same snippets rather than two label vectors. Plain pairwise co-membership agreement (e.g. F1 over "same group?" pairs) was tried first and rejected after direct measurement on this dataset: putting every snippet in a bag into one giant group scored 0.376 under raw pairwise F1 — HIGHER than a real trained baseline's 0.289 — because most snippet pairs in a bag are correctly not co-members by chance alone, and an uncorrected metric rewards that chance agreement instead of penalizing it. ARI subtracts out exactly this expected-by-chance agreement, which is why both degenerate submissions (one giant group, or every snippet its own group) score 0.000 here rather than a misleadingly positive number.

Why average per-bag rather than pool all snippets into one global score. Bags vary in size (16 to 50 snippets) and in how many true batches they contain (2 to 4, by construction — see Data). Pooling every snippet across all 110 bags into one flat ARI computation would let large bags dominate the score. Scoring each bag in isolation and averaging means every bag counts equally regardless of size. Note what per-bag scoring does not do: it does not by itself stop a solver from clustering the pooled test set and slicing the result back into bags — that is why the Rules above prohibit it explicitly.

The signal is noise, not content — measured. Because every snippet in a bag comes from a different article, approaches that read what the text says rather than how it is garbled were measured to fail: word-level TF-IDF clustering scores 0.079 and character n-gram TF-IDF scores 0.038 — both at the noise floor — against 0.342 for the shipped reference solution built on content-free OCR-noise features. A closed-set classifier that simply assigns each test snippet to its most likely training batch — ignoring that every test batch is unseen — reaches only 0.210. The separation is real, and it comes from the pipeline fingerprint rather than the subject matter.

Word TF-IDF is a weak baseline, not a content-blind one — snippet length is a real confound. Batches vary in mean text length by roughly 10x (measured: ~290 to ~3,050 characters per snippet, driven by article length and how much of the source region survived windowing), and one held-out batch is majority-Spanish. A trivial length-only feature (clustering on character count alone) scores 0.089 per bag — above the word-TF-IDF number above. This does not mean the task reduces to length or language: length-only is still well below the 0.342 reference and gives no bag-to-bag consistency an agent can build on, but it is a real, measured shortcut and not fully blocked by the current windowing. Solutions that lean on snippet length or language identity rather than character-level noise statistics will not generalise across the held-out batches the way the reference approach does.

Your submission's batch_id labels are your guessed groups, not real batch names. Values are entirely up to you — any tokens. They only need to be consistent WITHIN one bag (two snippets sharing a label means "I believe these came from the same batch"). Reusing the same label across different bags has no special meaning — every bag is scored independently.
ARI is chance-corrected: putting every snippet in one group, or every snippet in its own group, both score close to 0.000. This is intentional — those submissions carry no real information.
No group-count guess is required to be exactly right; ARI degrades gracefully with imperfect partitions rather than requiring an exact match.
Submission
Submit a CSV file named submission.csv with one row per bag and the following columns:

bag_id — the bag (the part of row_id before ::), copied from test.csv.
batch_id — your predicted group label for each snippet of that bag, whitespace-separated, in snippet order (the integer after ::: position 0 first, then 1, 2, …). Labels are any tokens without whitespace; two snippets sharing a label means "same batch". Labels only need to be consistent within one bag.
Example: a bag bag_0007 with snippets bag_0007::0 … bag_0007::4 that you believe come from three batches might be submitted as bag_0007,"0 1 0 2 1". sample_submission.csv shows the exact shape.

Requirements

Exactly one row per bag in test.csv — 110 rows plus the header — each bag_id exactly once.
batch_id must contain exactly as many labels as the bag has snippets.
Include a header row.
Rejected outright (the run does not score): a submission missing a required column.

Everything else costs points, not the run:

A missing bag scores 0 for that bag only; the rest is still graded.
A batch_id value that is empty or has the wrong number of labels scores 0 for that bag only.
A bag_id listed more than once: every conflicting row for that bag is discarded and the bag scores 0 — the grader does not pick one of the duplicates. The rest of the submission is still graded normally.
Rows for bags not in the current grading slice are ignored.
